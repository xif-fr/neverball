How to compile a binary of Neverball/Neverputt on OS X

1) Retrieve the dependencies. 
	
If not present, retrieve SDL2.framework and SDL2_ttf.framework from
	https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php (Development Libraries - Mac OS X)
and
	https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ (Development Libraries - Mac OS X)
respectively, and make sure the .framework are installed in /Library/Frameworks.

Additionally, the following must be installed, either by hand in /usr/local, with Homebrew or MacPorts :
	- gettext (for msgfmt)	( https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ )
	- libpng		( http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html )
	- libjpeg		( http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net )
	- libogg and libvorbis	( https://xiph.org/downloads/ )
If you plan to distribute Neverball/Neverputt (release version), the libraries
must be built as static libraries.

Warning ! If you want to build for an older version of OS X, you must ensure
backward compatibility when you compile libpng, libjpeg, libogg and libvorbis :
	export CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6"
	export LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6"
Moreover, in order for the static linking to work, you must compile these libraries
with Apple tools (especially ar) and not GNU tools. You can simply do
	export PATH=/usr/bin:${PATH}
before `./configure`. You don't need that if you don't plan to distribute.

SDL2, libpng, libjpeg and libvorbis/libogg will be statically linked the produced Neverball.app and Neverputt.app.

2) Check to make sure you have a fairly recent version of Xcode (tested with Xcode 6)

4) Prepare the build.

If you build a release version, delete the .build file.
Execute the following (at the root) to create share/version.h and locales :
	make locales
The "sdl2-config: Command not found" message can be safely ignored.

Then open the Xcode project macosx/xcode/neverball.xcodeproj

Change the version of targets "Neverball" and "Neverputt" accordingly.

5) Build mapc, compile the maps, and build Neverball/Neverputt

You can directy select the "Neverball" or "Neverputt" and build
	- development version with "Run" or Product > Build (⌘B) menu
	- release version with Product > Build For > Profiling (⇧⌘I)
First, `mapc` will be built and maps compiled (.map->.sol). This can be quite long (up to 30min)
depending on your computer. Then Neverball.app or Neverputt.app will be built and assembled :
	- for the development version, it is assumed that the (compiled) data/ directory
	  is already present as "/Library/Application Support/Neverball/data", which was
	  the case for 1.5.* versions of Neverball ; in this configuration, `mapc` is
	  also copied in "Neverball.app/Contents/MacOS/"
	- for the release version, relevant data and maps will be copied in each .app ;
	  this duplicates some data, but greatly facilitates distribution
	  (standalone .app, no installer needed)

Then, Neverball.app or Neverputt.app are ready to use or distribute standalone.
